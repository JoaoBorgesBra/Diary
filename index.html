        <h4>
            My name is Joao Vitor Barros, I am 27 years old and I am from Brazil. I was born in the countryside in the state of Minas Gerais where cattle farming is predominant.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            Despite my family's traditional background, I chose to follow a different path. Since I was young, I have always had a desire to explore the world.

        </h4>
        <h4>At the age of 17, I started to study programming for two years, then moved on to law. I never completed those courses as I moved to Sao Paulo to pursue my career as a professional model at the Allure agency. There, I developed a portfolio I am proud of, including the Sao Paulo Fashion Week, national campaigns, television commercials, Netflix productions, international campaigns for New York, and a campaign for Benetton, among others. At the same time, I was developing my international career, working in various countries in South America, Europe, and Asia.</h4>

On March 17, 2023, on a flight from Lisbon, Portugal, to Copenhagen, Denmark, I arrived with three suitcases and a dream – the dream of starting a new life in Malmo, Sweden. I had visited Sweden in January of the same year and was enchanted by what I saw. Even with the cold and winds, I wasn't deterred from making this important decision.

            <p><h2>Summer</h2></p>
            <p class="summer-text">
                I remember the moment I felt warmth for the first time after moving to Scandinavia. Walking the streets without winter/spring coats was liberating, and all I could think about was ICE CREAM. So, I went to the Italian gelateria near my home and asked the gentleman serving for my favorite ice cream, pistachio.

           <p><h2>Autumn</h2></p>
            <p class="autumn-text">
                After a beautiful summer with warm weather but still plunges into icy water, it was easy to notice how quickly the trees were changing colors. From green, they shifted to light yellow, then to dark orange until they became dry and fell to the ground with the strong winds, covering all the streets like an endless carpet.

            <p><h2>Winter</h2></p>
            <p class="winter-text">
                Despite having visited various countries, I had not lived for an extended period in a place where I could have the complete snow experience. During a brief season in Munich, Germany, I witnessed the end of winter where the snow was already melting. However, winter surprised me with the beautiful landscape I saw every day on the way from Malmo to Ystad for work. I felt like I was in a movie scene. I loved walking through the forest next to the center of Ystad, which is filled with houses that seem very cozy, especially with all the Christmas decorations and lit fireplaces.
