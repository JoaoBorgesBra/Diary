<h3><em>Here I will share my experiences as a foreigner in Sweden</em></h3>

<h5>My name is Joao Vitor Barros, I am 26 years old and I am from Brazil. I was born in the countryside in the state of Minas Gerais where cattle farming is predominant.

<p>Despite my family's traditional background, I chose to follow a different path. Since I was young, I have always had a desire to explore the world.
</p>
   
<p>At the age of 17, I started to study programming for two years, then moved on to law. I never completed those courses as I moved to Sao Paulo to pursue my career as a professional model at the Allure agency. There, I developed a portfolio I am proud of, including the Sao Paulo Fashion Week, national campaigns, television commercials, Netflix productions, international campaigns for New York, and a campaign for Benetton, among others. At the same time, I was developing my international career, working in various countries in South America, Europe, and Asia.
